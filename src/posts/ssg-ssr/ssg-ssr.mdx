Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side
Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.

- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at
  **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.
- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML
  on **each request**.

Importantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for
each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for
most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.

We recommend using **Static Generation** (with and without data) whenever
possible because your page can be built once and served by CDN, which makes it
much faster than having a server render the page on every request.

You can use Static Generation for many types of pages, including:

- Marketing pages
- Blog posts
- E-commerce product listings
- Help and documentation

You should ask yourself: "Can I pre-render this page **ahead** of a user's
request?" If the answer is yes, then you should choose Static Generation.

On the other hand, Static Generation is **not** a good idea if you cannot
pre-render a page ahead of a user's request. Maybe your page shows frequently
updated data, and the page content changes on every request.

In that case, you can use **Server-Side Rendering**. It will be slower, but the
pre-rendered page will always be up-to-date. Or you can skip pre-rendering and
use client-side JavaScript to populate data.
