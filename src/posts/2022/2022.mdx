I started sending out Christmas cards a few years ago because I always loved
receiving cards from my friends. I used to think it was something only married
couples and families got to do because none of my single friends ever sent any
cards. I couldn't wait for the time when I would finally be able to send out
Christmas cards. There were a lot of things that I wanted to do but always felt
like I had to have a partner to do them. Eventually, I decided I no longer
wanted to wait to have a man in my life to do certain things, so I sent out the
Christmas cards, I started traveling and doing things for nobody other than
myself, and it was one of the best things I could've done.

To preface everything I'm going to share about this year, you should know that
22 is my _all time_ favorite number. I don't have true "favorites" of anything,
but 22 is _definitely_ my favorite number (and has been since I was 10).
Needless to say, I had high expectations for my year, what with it being 2022
and all. I apologize in advance because those that know me know I love to write,
and this may end up sucking you into a world of words that you didn't realize
you were signing up for. My life changed a lot this year, sometimes in small,
subtle ways that took me a while to notice, and sometimes in large,
unapologeticly loud waves, that, though, I enjoyed, I did not see coming. As
much as this is meant to be a way I share my life with friends and family, it's
also something I'm doing for myself to look back at and record all the ways my
heart was filled this year, to be thankful for the joy and the pain that have
brought me to this moment.

<br />

## Let's rewind a bit (2021)

For those of you that don't know, I was named Josefina after my Abuela Josefina,
my dad's mom. My grandma lived her whole life in Guatemala, where my dad is
from. Though, my parents took me once to visit as a toddler, I don't remember
any of it. For all practical purposes, I have never been to Guatemala, and I
have never met my family there in person (except for one uncle who lived with us
when I was in elementary school). When Abuela Josefina died last year from
covid, I didn't expect for her death to hit me as hard as it did. I had spent
all my life only getting to know her through the other side of a phone, skype
calls and letters. The older I got, the less often we talked, something I regret
and wish I had appreciated more. Abuela Josefina was an enigma to me. She was
someone who was both a stranger and yet very significant to my life. She was the
past, the present, the future. It's something that's hard to explain to people
who haven't lived the same experiences as immigrants or children of immigrants.
Even my experience is completely different than my parents, and theirs
completely different than their parents, but there's a shared understanding of
the two worlds we hold in our hearts. For me, Abuela Josefina was a symbol of
everything I was, a reminder of everything I should be, where I truly come from
and the people who I live for. She was as much a part of me as the blood that
runs through my veins. She was a paradox. She was like a fairy tale, something
intangible and dreamy, because I hoped, I so badly hoped and dreamed and
imagined that one day I would go to Guatemala and be able to hug her in person,
I would be able to see her face to face, the woman who gave me my name and,
unknowingly, everything else about my life.

When she died, my heart broke and I couldn't understand why. Even now, as I
think about it over a year later, I barely understand it, how someone could feel
so close and yet so far away. Here's a woman I only ever knew from a distance,
and yet, it hurt to lose her. It was surreal at first, the thought that I
wouldn't be able to meet her anymore, the pain, the disbelief. Sometimes I
pretend she's still alive (not in a creepy, put her in a mental hospital kind of
way). Maybe a better way to phrase it is sometimes I feel like she's still
alive. Like if I never go to Guatemala, she will always be alive there, but if I
go, I have to accept that she is no longer there. I don't know if I'll ever
visit, but if I do, I know I will no longer get to see her, talk to her, touch
her, and I hate the universe for that.

I wish I could go back and change things. I wish I could go back and talk to her
more, call her more, write to her more. I wish I could go back and visit before
it was too late. I can't do any of those things. What I could do, was try not to
let it happen again with the rest of my family. Somehow, at some point last
year, I struck up a conversation with my mom about her family in Mexico, family
that I didn't know. I have always dreamed of living in Mexico City, where my mom
was born and where my parents lived for a while after they married, but part of
me always felt like that was just a dream. After my grandma died, I had this
growing desire to go to Mexico for a while by myself to meet the family I didn't
know and to experience Mexico on my own terms. I wanted to discover my own
friendships and adventures, have my own relationships with family, not through
my parents but through my own accord. I also wanted none of it, not because I
didn't want it, but because it was scary. It felt easier to say _I would love to
have this, but it's scary so actually... just kidding!_

One day, I shared some of my thoughts with my best friend about wanting to visit
Mexico for a while, taking advantage of this perfect time in my life where I
don't have any relational committments, children, or a job tying me down to a
specific place (I've been working from home since the start of the pandemic). I
can't remember exactly what he said but it was the reassurance I needed to hear,
and somehow I found the courage in me to plan my solo trip. I'm thankful for
that conversation, it gave me the boost of confidence I needed to plan something
that changed my life. So before the year even ended, I had booked an Airbnb for
2 months of the following year, and I began planning my visit.

<br />

## Friends high and low

The first half of my year feels like it had a one recurring theme:
relationships. The rekindling of them, discovering them, reconnecting with old
friends, making new ones in unexpected ways and just spending quality time with
some of my existing friends.

### January

At the start of the year I had the amazing opportunity to visit one of my
besties, Andrea, and her partner in Salt Lake City, Utah. It was my first time
visiting Utah. I had been wanting to go for years because I love the outdoors
and every picture I saw of it was just breathtaking. It did not disappoint. I
skiied for the first time (and possibly last time) in my life, but by far my
favorite part of the trip was when we hiked a snowy mountain and ate lunch at
the top. When I think about this time, it feels surreal because of how different
my life is now, how different I feel now. In fact, my weekend in Utah feels like
a lifetime ago. It's hard to believe it was really this year.

### February

This year Gunny turned 8 on February 8th. I celebrated 8 years of the best
relationship I've ever had, 8 anniversaries of the best decision I've ever made.
I also celebrated Valentine's Day for the first time in years because single
people deserve it too haha My cousins Brendita and Dahlia snuck a whole ass
steak and potatoes tupperware into the movie theatre that night so we could dine
fancy while watching our movie.

I went on our annual climbing trip to El Potrero Chico (Hidalgo, Nuevo León, MX)
with some of my bestest climbing buds: Patrick, Tenley, Amy and Patrick 2. We
roadtripped out there and spent a few days sport climbing beautiful limestone
walls. I introduced my friends to the world of Bad Bunny (I, of course, blasted
his music when it was my turn to drive) and thus was how our group "The Bad
Bunnies" came to be.

In February, I spent a lot of time with extended family. This was a hard month,
a bittersweet month, because my uncle passed away. It was filled with tears and
laughter, joy and pain. It was another reminder that life is short and we are
never prepared to lose people. For me it was another reminder to cherish my
family, to show up more, be together more. It was during this time, one day,
that my cousin Christy and I biked all over downtown Austin as we cheered on our
friend Miguelito while he ran the Austin Marathon. I remember that day being
full of laughter and love, and even though it was just one day of the year, it
was one of my favorite days. I know for me, it was a day that I needed. I
remember going home that day with a heart so full.

### March

I attended a friend's wedding and was reunited with old friends from college.
Even though this, too, was just one day of the year, it was actually really
meaningful to me because this was a group of friends who were a big part of my
life in college: ROTC. My closest friends and family know that my last 2 years
of college weren't particularly happy, in fact they were the worst years of my
life. I was in a dark place for a long time, and I shut everyone out. I just cut
off most of my relationships, especially my Navy and Marine Corps ones. For a
few years after college I wondered what would have happened if I had opened up
to people about what I was going through. Would my life have played out
differently? Would they have understood or helped me? I don't know. What I do
know, is that for the first time since college, the thought of opening up my
life again to these people didn't feel painful or scary. It brought me a lot of
joy.

In March I also spent a lot of time working on my bus with my dad, and my
friends Fernando and Dee. As many of you know, I have been working on this bus
for-freaking-ever. Sometimes (a lot of times) it's stressful, but I'm so
incredibly thankful for all the people who have helped me along the way. This
time of the year was really fun because we got so much momentum going on the
bus. I remember being so motivated to work; we were just knocking out one thing
after the other. Spring was upon us, the weather was nice, we were making
amazing progress, just hanging out weekend after weekend outside my house,
blasting rancheras as we did our Bob the Builder thing. Honestly, they were good
times with good people.

### April and May

Finally the time had come for me to go on my long awaited trip to Mexico! I was
pretty dang scared. Even though I grew up going to Mexico, I had never been by
myself, and certainly not for this long. I wasn't just scared of going there by
myself as a woman, I was nervous about meeting my family. There were a lot of
things I was uncertain about. What if I got lonely? What if I got homesick? What
if I didn't make any friends? What if I felt too scared to go out on my own?
What if I suddenly forgot all the Spanish I knew and couldn't talk to anyone
(that one was unlikely, but I was nervous about speaking Spanish 24/7)? What if
my family didn't like me? What if I was too American? What if I felt like I
didn't belong? What if? All these what if's running through my head in the weeks
leading up to my trip. I talked a lot about it with my therapist. We came up
with plans for everything: how I could let my family know if I was feeling
lonely, who I could call or FaceTime, practicing how to ask people I barely knew
if I could spend time with them, and so much more.

I've long considered myself to be introverted because I am not someone who goes
out and finds friends or engages with strangers. I think most of my life, many
of the friends I've made always befriended me first or were more outgoing than I
was. I love spending time in community, but within the comfort of people I know.
This year, however, I wanted to push myself beyond my comfort and really focus
on relationships: being more intentional with existing ones and having the
courage to cultivate new ones. I have Abuela Josefina to thank for that. She was
the spark that started it all. So a big part of this trip for me was about
forcing myself to stretch those muscles and dive into uncomfortable situations
to see what treasures I could find. I truly did find a treasure: new family and
friends not soon forgotten.

I had the time of my life in Mexico. Everything about it was a dream. I loved
the food. I loved walking everywhere. I loved the neighorhood I was staying in,
Condesa. I loved my wonderful Airbnb hosts, Alex and Juan Pablo, and their
beautiful home. I loved getting to see the city and go to different museums. I
loved spending time in Chapultepec reading books. I loved going to EnHorabuena
coffee shop to read by myself or draw. I loved making friends, and none of it
scared me once I was there. I saw beauty everywhere and felt joy and peace in
every moment.

I loved being able to speak Spanish everywhere I went. I truly was nervous about
that part, because as much as I speak Spanish at home, I don't speak it 24/7. I
was surprised at how much Spanish I soaked up immediately. My brain was
oversaturated with Spanish everywhere, in the little places that most residents
probably don't notice, but I did - the grocery store labels, the road signs, the
book stores, random conversations I'd overhear between strangers as I walked
down the street. I'd hear words that I knew but had long forgotten from not
having used them in years and it literally brought me so much joy! _I know that
word! I had forgotten about it, but I know it!_ I loved living the entirety of
my life in Spanish.

I loved that everywhere I went everyone could say my name right and spell it
correctly; a lot of Americans don't really seem to understand how to pronounce
Josefina or spell my name (story of my life). I loved the climbing gym I went
to, Adamanta in Escandón. When I was planning my trip, I made sure to book
somewhere that was within walking distance of a climbing gym so that I could
keep working out and climbing, more than anything because if I got too scared to
venture out on my own or make friends, I would at least have that as a safe
space. I miss that gym so much and I miss the friends I made there.

What I loved most about this trip was spending time with my family both in
Mexico City and León, Guanajuato. What surprised me most about it was that I
immediately felt at home with everyone, which I had hoped for but wasn't sure
would happen. It was all better than I expected. In fact, I was shocked because
I am not someone who typically feels comfortable with people I just met (again,
I'm pretty introverted sometimes). All the while I was there, I kept thinking:
_how is is possible that I could meet someone and love them so fast?_ That's how
I felt about my family. I don't really know what I was expecting, but I wasn't
expecting that. Not because I didn't think they were good people, but because I
thought that there might be an awkwardness that sometimes exists between people
who don't really know each other. I felt none of that. Maybe what helped is that
in a way I didn't feel like a stranger, hearing stories about my mom and her
family made me feel connected. I got to see the home my mom grew up in, the
school she went to, the park where she and her cousins played, old family photo
albums. I am incredibly thankful for all the time I got to spend with my family.
I am thankful for everyone welcoming me into their homes, for showing me around,
taking me out to eat, taking the time to know me and love me. Above all, I am
thankful for these new relationships in my life.

### June

This was a fun month (mostly). I was a bridesmaid in my friend Destiny's
wedding. She is one of the strongest people I know, one of the best
relationships that came out of my time in ROTC, and getting to celebrate an
important day with her literally brought tears to my eyes. The wedding was in
California, and I had just gotten back from Mexico, and was planning on staying
in Cali for a few weeks to visit with other Navy friends. Gunny was already
pretty butt hurt that I left her for so long when I went to Mexico, so I decided
to roadtrip to San Diego so she could come with. I love a good roadtrip, so
driving the 19 hours there with my baby in the backseat was thrilling! Blasting
music, driving with the windows down, seeing the sunset in the desert. In Cali,
we stayed with one of our besties, Gretchen and her dog Whiskey. Though there
were a lot of external factors that made this time of the year really hard
(mourning with the Latino and immigrant community after the Uvalde shooting, Roe
v. Wade being overturned), being with close friends and finding peace in the
small moments got me through this month. In particular, walking with the dogs
along the beach every day grounded me so much. I remember my heart being so
still after every walk.

## The dog days of summer and some other weird times

### July

The summer in Texas this year was one of the hottest in a long time. I'm a Texas
gal, through and through, and can usually do just about anything in the heat,
but this summer sucked. One month, it was like 100-105 every day for 2 weeks
straight. It was during this time that Austin Pets Alive reached out to the
community for help. All of their dogs live in kennels outside, and even though
they have shade and fans, with the relentless heat of the Texas summer, it just
wasn't enough. They needed people to foster dogs to get them out of the heat.

Now, I live with my parents, and we had a full house at the time: mom, dad,
Roni, Elena, Justin, myself, my dog Gunny, my mom's dog Mancha, and Elena's cats
Benny and Betita. Not only that, but we have been slowly renovating the house
for the better part of 2 years now, so we've been living in craziness, and
introducing another dog to the mix was just going to add to that craziness.
Still, I couldn't bear the thought of poor puppies being stuck in a kennel
outside in the Texas heat. I asked my dad if he would allow me to foster a dog
for a short while, and, shockingly, he agreed.

We went to the shelter together to sign up to be emergency fosters and take a
dog home for a few weeks. That was the plan, at least. On July 13, we took Papas
and Luna home with us. They were two 4-month old siblings who had just recently
survived parvo, and were on a distemper watch (another deadly virus). I had
never heard of distemper so I had no idea what I was getting myself into. Their
shelter names were Tomahawk (Papas) and Spicy (Luna). I hated those names, they
were terrible, truly, so I gave them names that fit their personality. Big
mistake. Nobody tells you that when you rename fosters you get attached to
them... more than anything, I got attached to Luna because of her demeanor. When
we left the shelter with her, she was this ball of nervousness. While Papas was
eager to be out, and wanted to socialize with people, Luna was scared of
everyone and everything. She never wanted to come out of her kennel because she
felt safe there, and when she did, she would only follow Papas. He was her
comfort and protection. She was also very fragile and thin, after surviving
parvo. Everything in me just wanted her to know she was safe, and I don't know
how or why but she seemed to understand that.

At first, Luna struggled with her health: she was barely eating, had a cough and
mucus. I was in constant contact with the vets from APA, but after putting her
on antibiotics, she improved so fast. She started eating normal, and became
energetic. She was coming out of her shell, playing with the dogs. We would
spend all day together (I work from home), and in the evenings I would sit
outside with the dogs while they played or hung out. I loved every second of it.
I fell in love with her tender heart, and I could tell she loved me too. Soon
enough she was following me everywhere, and even though she would still
sometimes get afraid with other people, she was never afraid of me. It didn't
take long for me to know I wanted to adopt her.

One day out of the blue, Luna started having seizures. When I spoke to the vets,
we realized the distemper virus had progressed to the stage where it was
affecting her neurological system. For days we tried everything. I took care of
her day and night, giving her all sorts of medication and fluids, syringe
feeding her because of how weak she had gotten. By the end of the week, we knew
she wasn't going to get better. I had hoped with everything in me that she would
survive, but I knew the kindest thing for her was to let her go. I never knew I
could love another dog like that. I've had Gunny for almost 9 years now, and
she's my whole world. I always thought that I would never be able to love
another dog the way I love Gunny, but when Luna came into my life, I realized I
was wrong. My heart grew. My heart loved more. Losing her was so hard and felt
so unfair. I was heartbroken for her; I had imagined a whole life of sitting out
in the yard with her, with the dogs, and now I was losing her. I was angry
because she could have had a chance, I thought. She could have had a chance if
whoever had her before the shelter had just taken care of her. She had barely
lived at all. But mostly, I was honored that for the few weeks that I had her,
she felt safe and loved with me.

After that I adopted Papas, my sweet boy who is full of spiciness and energy. He
is sometimes a pain who has chewed up so many of my shoes, but he's my baby. He
is everything I never wanted in a dog: very vocal, high energy, a little
reactive, mischievous, part Husky (fml). And yet, he won my heart over.

### August

I'm realizing now that I went to Mexico three different times this year. This
time, I went back to Mexico City with my parents. Up until this year, the last
time we were all three together in Mexico City, I was 14. We went for my, baby
cousin, Macarena's baptism. I was both ecstatic about being in Mexico with my
parents, getting to show them the places I went and the people I met, as I was
to spend time with my new-found family, even if just for the weekend.

### September

After Luna died, I struggled a bit getting back into my normal routine. I lost
interest in all my usual activities. On top of that, I started becoming more and
more unhappy at work. I found the only way to keep going was just to keep
fostering. Helping dogs made my heart feel better, so in September I took in
three 8-week old puppies. Gunny was not particularly happy about the puppies.
This time around I made sure not to rename them: Oolong, English Breakfast and
Sencha. Once again, I found myself enjoying my evenings outside with all the
dogs. My hands were full, with so many untrained puppies, who also seemed to
never wanna sleep at night, but it kept me busy and that's what I needed. Oolong
and English Breakfast got adopted quickly, but Sencha stayed with us for a few
weeks before getting adopted. He and Papas became best friends, playing and
napping together all the time. It was hard to say goodbye to him, but I knew
that it meant I could then save another dog's life.

### October

At the start of October, I signed up to foster another dog: Darwin. I knew
almost nothing about him. After I started fostering with APA, I started
receiving regular emails from them about dogs needing fosters. Darwin was in one
of those emails. APA didn't know much about him because he was at another
shelter that was running out of space. All I saw was a picture of a cute boy
with a goofy grin, and knowing nothing, I signed up to foster him. I was very
nervous about it. Up until that point, all the fosters we'd had were young
puppies, and Darwin was a bit older and bigger. I knew, potentially, it would be
harder to introduce him to our dogs. It was chaotic at first, but he quickly
became part of the pack. Darwin is a Dutch Shepherd (he looks like a German
Shepherd with a brindle coat). I've met shepherds and other working dogs, and I
have never wanted to own one; they are high energy and I like to be lazy. When I
signed up to foster him I thought I was pretty safe from falling in love with
him, but I was not prepared for how endearing he would be. Darwin is a lover who
just wants to please his humans. He quickly made us all fall in love with him.
I'm so happy I took a chance on him. In the end my mom adopted him and now we
are his forever family and he is ours.

After 4 years at IBM, I decided it was time for me to leave. During this month,
I spent a lot of time updating my portfolio (this website), my resume, applying
to jobs, studying for interviews, interviewing. It was a bittersweet time.
While, I loved the time I was at IBM, work changed so much for me in 2022 and I
no longer enjoyed it. It was hard to deal with at first, but with the support of
my friends, my favorite coworkers, and my family, I moved forward with looking
for jobs. I will forever cherish my time there; it started off my career. I got
to meet amazing people who became great friends of mine, and learned so much
from them. Even though job hunting was stressful, I felt confident in everything
I had learned while at IBM.

In mid October, I turned 28 and I celebrated by renting out a small cabin with a
hot tub out in the middle of nowhere. I spent a few days out there with Gunny
and Papas, reading, blasting music, dancing, getting a little tipsy, and just
enjoying being in the moment with nobody other than myself. Even though I had
been struggling with depression the last half of the year, I was so thankful for
where I was. I was thankful for reconnecting, rebuilding and discovering old and
new relationships, some that I never thought I would rediscover, finding healing
in places I didn't think I'd find healing. I was thankful that in my late
twenties I could be happy to be alive and how different that was compared to my
early twenties when I just wanted to die. I was thankful that I could find
stillness even in the difficult moments, thankful for my dogs. Words are
hopelessly insufficient. It felt magical. I wish I could describe it better. It
felt nothing short of a miracle. I hadn't felt that kind of happiness since I
was in Mexico in the spring. It seemed like everything in between got darker for
me, but suddenly, for my birthday I had a little bit of peace. As is tradition,
for the 4th year in a row, I also celebrated by going out to the crag for some
birthday climbing with my dear friend, Tommy.

### November

I spent the whole of November being "funemployed." Having just quit my job at
IBM. At first I didn't have a job lined up, but within a week I got a job offer
from H-E-B. While I wanted to be productive during this time off, mostly, I
wanted to rest so I could feel mentally prepared to start my new job. I spent a
lot of time with friends, family, and the dogs. I celebrated our 3rd annual
Friendsgiving with my climbing friends; we had a whole feast at the crag! This
year, my family and I had a smaller celebration than usual for Thanksgiving, but
the highlight of the week was having my cousin Dani and my aunt Adri visit from
Mexico. During this time I saw my family fill my cup in ways I didn't know they
could. We laughed so much, loved so much. Even though it was just a few days, I
felt so much closer to the family I had only just met this spring. Looking back
now, I am a thousand times thankful that I didn't give into my fears, and
planned my trip to Mexico. Though, I had been feeling a bit depressed and was
nervous to start my new job, spending time with my family gave me everything I
needed to be excited again. I started my new role as a software engineer at
H-E-B the week after Thanksgiving, and I have been enjoying every moment of it.

## “i have laughed more than daffodils and cried more than June.” ― Sanober Khan

In the end, this year was equal parts joy and sadness. It felt like the first
half of my year was wonderful ― mentally, physically and emotionally. The second
half, felt not as great. I also don't really know why, but I struggled a lot
with my depression the last half of the year. It's difficult for me when I go
through that, mostly because I've always had high expectations for myself. I
stopped working out and climbing regularly, stopped working on the bus, and had
a hard time doing the things I love and being productive. I've had to remind
myself a lot these past few months to allow myself some grace. _I will bounce
back, I always have. Time and again._ But even in the sadness, there was
something different about it, something I can't quite put my finger on. I don't
know what it was, I just know that I felt different. I have to think it has to
do with my relationships (and my dogs). A big part of my year was being in
community, and it was evident when I was feeling down, how much of an impact my
friends and family have on my life.

_To my friends and family, if you read all of this, I truly appreciate it and I
hope that you enjoyed some of it, if not everything. Feel free to reach out and
share the parts you liked or if anything resonated with you. I would love to
hear from you!_

_Con mucho amor, Tote_
